\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

The pertinence of this work has been demonstrated considering the related work presented.
The state of the art robots for elderly is focused on service robots to guide them in their daily tasks.
Considering the companion type robots for aged people, existing technology is focused on therapy especially for the disabled.
However, the proposed robot aims to interact with elderly in a specific scenario for an entertaining and stimulating activity.

The \emph{Sueca} player will be based on Monte Carlo methods that are currently being successfully used on similar card games.
Additionally, in order to balance the power of this artificial player, an opponent modelling will also be included.
This artificial player should be a challenging opponent for the elderly players, although considering their average skills and level.

The mentioned pilot user study has also been elaborated in order to introduce the robots theme into the elderly lives and anticipate some problems that might occur in further studies.

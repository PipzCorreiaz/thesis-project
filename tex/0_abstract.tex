Regarding the needs of the ageing population, technology can be the answer to some of them. For instance, existing robots already guide the elderly walking through the house, or are companions for cuddling and petting. In the same way, this work aims to create a companion robot that plays the card game \emph{Sueca}. The idea is to develop an entertaining and pleasuring environment that can additionally stimulate their reasoning.
After reviewing the related work, this report presents an artificial player based on Monte Carlo methods and the architecture that will use it. Considering the game state, the chosen move and some of the environment perceptions, this robot must produce an appropriate behaviour to be considered as socially present during the game.

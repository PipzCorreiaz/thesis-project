\subsection{Game theory concepts}

Game theory studies decision making problems involving multiple decision makers.
A problem of this nature is usually called a game and defines a set of constraints to the players' actions.
Game theory also studies the strategies these players might take and the properties of each game.
Nowadays this subject is applied to many different areas, such as economics, political science, biology or computer science.

Each one of the decision makers tries to maximise the payoff/reward of his possible actions.
In order to do that, a possible approach is trying to consider the opponents' actions.
Consequently, the Nash-equilibrium of a game is a stable strategy for every player and occurs when each player chooses the best strategy for himself, considering their opponents have the same behaviour.
Each player cannot have a better benefit by changing his strategy.

Games can be categorised according to the hierarchy of Figure~\ref{fig:games}.
In a cooperative game, players cooperate with one another in order to achieve a common goal.
Alternatively, in a non-cooperative game, players work independently for their own purposes.
Non-cooperative games can also be branched in two forms: normal form and extensive form \cite{Shoham2010}.
A normal form game can be defined as the tuple $(N,(A_k)_{k=1}^{N},(u_k)_{k=1}^{N})$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ is the number of players;
\item $A_k$ is the finite set of available actions for the $k$-th player;
\item $u_k$ is the payoff for the $k$-th player.
\end{itemize}
Considering the players' payoffs, there is another relevant concept, the zero-sum game.
In a zero-sum game, the sum of all players' payoffs is zero.
For instance, in a zero-sum 2 players game, $u_1 = -u_2$.
Although the normal form games assume that players' actions are made simultaneously, in the extensive form games the players' actions are sequential.
This evidence leads to another branching in the hierarchy of games.
On one hand, an extensive game can be considered as perfect information.
This means each player knows exactly the real state of his opponents, (e.g. Chess).
On the other hand, in an imperfect information game, the state of opponents is hidden (e.g. card games).

Regarding the focus of this work on a card game, another relevant point on the top of hidden information games is the the definition of information set.
An information set agregates several nodes representing unknown information such as choice nodes. In a card game, for instance, the information set of a player, whos cards are hidden, corresponds to all the possible combinations of his hand.

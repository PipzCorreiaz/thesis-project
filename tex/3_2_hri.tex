\subsection{Human-robot interaction}

Regarding the goals of this project, it is crucial to investigate and evaluate the state of the art of \gls{hri}.
The social robot that is proposed aims to interact with aged people in a card game scenario.
Due to this ambition, there are two clear branches that must be studied.
Firstly, the existing robots with an elderly care purpose.
Secondly, how social agents have been integrated into games.
The next subsections will address these points.



\subsubsection{Robots in elderly care}


The greying of population is an undeniable demographic question.
As a result, assisting the elderly in their daily living is a worrying subject.
In order to address this problem, robots can be a valuable aid.
Replacing human carers is an ambitious task due to the limited capabilities of current robot technology.

Although these limitations, robots can be useful in more distinct tasks.

In 2009, Broekens have analysed and reviewed the most relevant literature about social robots in elderly care until that date.
The authors have categorised assistive robots for elderly as shown in figure~\ref{fig:categorization}.
The first division distinguishes social robots from nonsocial robots.
These nonsocial ones are used for rehabilitation purposes and physical assistance, such as a smart wheelchair or an artificial limb.
Regarding the main purposes of this work, nonsocial robots will not be discussed.
The social ones should be perceived as social entities due to their interaction with humans.
They can also be divided into two different sets, service type and companion type.
The intersection of these two sets represents some of the robots that cannot be strictly categorized.

A well known social service robot is \emph{Pearl}.
It was developed in the Carnegie Mellon University within the Nursebot Project.
\emph{Pearl} can be defined as a nursebot considering its main goal is guiding aged people.
One of this autonomous robot's duty is guiding the elderly through their environment.
Likewise, it frequently reminds them about their daily activities, such as eating or taking the medicines.
In other words, this functional assistant is capable of giving advices and providing cognitive support.
When analysing \emph{Pearl} through a more general \gls{ai} point of view, this robot is equipped with many different techonologies.
Firstly, it has a speech recognition module and also has speech synthesis.
Secondly, it has stereo camera systems and performs a fast image processing including face recognition.
Lastly, \emph{Pearl} also provides a navigation system and its body is touch sensitive.

Another two similar robots of service type are \emph{RoboCare} and \emph{Care-O-bot II}.
They both are autonomous and provide indoor guidance to the elderly.
Their advanced domotic components together with strong planning and scheduling frameworks can improve the independece of their owners.
The aid these service type robots grant to elderly represent mostly of their basic daily activities.
Consequently, the involved concerns are amplified when comparing to the proposed robot that plays a card game.
These worries are reflected, for instance, in the extensive amount of sensors service robots should include.

\emph{Paro} is considered a companion robot.
This seal shaped robot is used as medical therapy for elderly.
Since 2003 the work of Wada et. al. tries to evaluate psychological, physiological and social effects of \emph{Paro} on the residents of care house.
This robot contains a behaviour generation system that provides proactive, reactive and physiological reactions, such as poses or motions, looking at the direction of a sound and sleeping, respectively.
Their studies of both three weeks and one year shown improvements in residents' moods, depression and stress levels.
They also reveal an increase of their social interations.
The goal of such a robot is fully inspired in animal-assisted treatments, which have studied benefits in humans' health.
However, hospitals and health centres do not allow animals due to hygienic and safety reasons.
Hence, researchers found a great opportunity to build similar robotic animals.

Another example of a purely companion robot is \emph{Huggable}.
It is covered of extremely sensitive touch sensors.
The \emph{Huggable} not only detects hard and soft touches, but also distinguishes between an object and a human touch.
The teddy bear shaped robot is connected to a computer in the nurses' station and allow the staff to access the sensory input data.
A possible usage of that data in an hospital is detecting fear or insecurity by the way people hold the robot.
Purely companion robots in elderly care have only been applied to people with some kind of psychological or physiological disorder.
As a result, these studies have distinct target audiences and also different concerns when compared to the purposes of the proposed robot.


\emph{Aibo} illustrates a robot that can be assigned to both the service type and the companion type.
It is considered by its creators as an entertainment robot.
This is a dog shaped robot and its appearance tries to maintain a lifelike experience to its owners.
The authors affirm that a fault in a service robot might cause serious problems.
This idea influenced them to create a robot that would not be life-threatening, such as \emph{Aibo}.
Other researchers started to study the acceptance and effects of this robot on elders with severe dementia.
Their study revealed a relevant increase of social actions, emotions and feelings of comfort about past memories.
Considering the goals of the proposed robot, \emph{Aibo} is much more close to our goals than the other mentioned robots.
A possible explanation is that both robots have an entertainment purpose.
